These are rough notes on things that are important to remember when porting
this data elsewhere. Eventually should be put into a manual.

installation steps:
-add env varialbe PYTHONSTARTUP=config.py
	this will read config.py in folder if present
-add ~/.config/matplotlib/matplotlibrc file 
	(right now just use it to remove interpolation in images)

-need to make sure matplotlib 1.4 or higher installed (for the customization of plots)
    sudo apt-get install libfreetype6-dev
    sudo pip3 install --upgrade matplotlib #(or pip if using python2)
- When installing the lz4 plugin, these variables need to be set:
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/research/data/yager150726/hdf5-1.8.15-patch1/hdf5/lib:/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
	export C_INCLUDE_PATH=~/research/data/yager150726/hdf5-1.8.15-patch1/hdf5/include
	export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=~/research/data/yager150726/hdf5-1.8.15-patch1/hdf5/include:/usr/include
	#export HDF5_PLUGIN_PATH=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
	export HDF5_PLUGIN_PATH=/home/julienl/research/data/yager150726/HDF5Plugin-master
-New python git use the .gitignore template from here (and don't forget to add it):
    https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Python.gitignore
    -append to .gitignore:
        pyscripts
        pylists
        pystorage
-set up your sym links (if you want): pyscripts, pylists, pystorage
-Great quick guide to git: http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/
-move the examples/sampleconfig.py to config.py and have the variables
    point to the correct directories
-install lmfit (sudo pip3 install lmfit)

notes:
- the current EIGER reading code (detector.EigerFile) is only temporary. Once
  CHX gets their EIGER code working with python3, it will be used here.

code practices:
-keep scripts out of main code directory. place a soft link to scripts
directory and add it to the gitignore
-if code is taken from elsewhere, add a #ref symbol for later review
