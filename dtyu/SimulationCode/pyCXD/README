pyCXD - python Coherent Xray Diffraction (too general of a name, should we change?)

File Structure:
    config.py - some initial configuration code (from config import * should be the first line of every script)
    examples/ - good examples on how to run code (i.e. supporting code examples
        for a manual. Should be as self contained as possible, (Sometimes it
        cannot be so, such as when reading a data file)
    io/ - all reading/writing routines
    plot/ - plotting tools 
    pylists/ - softlink to any lists that python might use to start batch reading data
    pyscripts/ - softlink to any test scripts run 
    tools/ - general tools involving xray stuff

The idea:
    Everything in this directory should be portable code. Anything
cumbersome should be kept out of it. Soft links into other code from
this directory is okay.

Suggested structure for the rest of data:
DDIR - directory where data is located
SDIR - directory where extra information is stored (eventually
    calculation of higher order statistics which require post processing
    stuff like mask creation. Basically anything computed from the data
    that required some extra information added in before computing)
LISTSDIR - directory where any lists describing data is located
SCRIPTSDIR - anything that's run as a prototype once that cannot be
    built upon in the future (ex: figure generation scripts, testing,
    benchmarking etc.)
