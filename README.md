# DeepLearningXRay

Double-view CNN walkthrough: Walkthrough on how to make changes and run the pprograms that generate the 
..synthetic x-ray scattering images and pre-process them for deep learning training and testing, and
..then how to train and test the system. (Programs are in dtyu folder and the dtyu.zip files)
